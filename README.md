# 2020 Sri Lanka Parliamentary Election Results Analysis using Power BI 📊

I completed a comprehensive data visualization project analyzing the results of recently concluded Sri Lanka’s 2020 Parliamentary Election using Power BI.

### The project focused on:

📍 Electoral District Map Designing: Designed a custom map marking the boundaries of the 22 electoral districts using Synoptic Designer for Power BI.

📍 Electoral Districts Breakdown: Visualized votes and percentages for major candidates across all 22 districts.

📍 Dynamic Visuals: Built interactive dashboards where users can filter data by district, dynamically displaying district-specific results.  

📍 Key Insights: The dashboard enabled me to dive deep into voting patterns, highlighting key electoral trends and providing meaningful insights for future election strategies.

📍 Custom DAX Queries: Leveraged advanced DAX queries to calculate percentages, sum values, and create dynamic text-based measures for a more tailored user experience.

📍 Powerful Visualizations: Used stacked bar charts, cards, and other visuals to present data clearly and effectively.
